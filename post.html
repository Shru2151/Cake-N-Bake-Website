				<h2>Butterscotch Cake</h2>
				<p>Butterscotch is claimed to have been first named in 1817 in Doncaster, England by Samuel Parkinson. He had begun making the candy earlier under the name of buttery brittle toffee. The company that produced the candy received the Royal Seal of Approval for their highly demanded export. Though it is considered merely a flavor today, butterscotch was historically a hard candy created with brown sugar and butter. Some recipes will include vanilla, syrup (particularly for sauces), cream, salt, and even lemon. The coveted original recipe was discovered in 2003 by a businessman in Doncaster (the original company stopped production in 1977) and is still being used today by particular businesses.

				<h2>Chocolate Cake</h2>
				<p>Chocolate cake is made with chocolate. It can also include other ingredients.[1] These include fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners. The history of chocolate cake goes back to the 17th century, when cocoa powder from the Americas were added to traditional cake recipes.[2] In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical extraction method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into powder.[3] The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an inexpensive daily snack

				<h2>Vanilla Cake</h2>
				<p>Most cakes begin with creaming butter and sugar together. Butter is capable of holding air and the creaming process is when butter traps that air. While baking, that trapped air expands and produces a fluffy cake.
					Baking powder is a mixture of baking soda and tartaric acid. When mixed with water the sodium hydrogen carbonate(baking soda) reacts with tartaric acid, as a result, carbon dioxide gas is liberated. This carbon dioxide is trapped in wet dough and bubbles out slowly making the cake soft and spongy. </p>

				<h2>Ice-Cream Cake</h2>
				<p>An ice cream cake is a cake made with ice cream. ... A popular form is a three-layer cake, with a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake. In a typical assembly, the cake component is baked in the normal way, cut to shape if necessary, and then frozen.
					If you don't finish the cake in one sitting, wrap it up and place it back in the freezer. Seal your cake in an airtight container to prevent it from getting frost bitten. If your ice cream cake is frozen and sealed tight, it will keep for several months as long as it's well hidden. </p>
